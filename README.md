# portfolio-second-draft

New markup for portfolio site

Taking another crack at a portfolio site because the first one turned into kind of a mess. Starting from scratch for this one. I have a vision for it that I'm going to try to sketch out on paper before I get to creating. Like the first draft, this site is meant to house my projects I've created from self study in the Odin Project and Jonas Shmeddtman curriculums.

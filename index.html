        <p class="about-content">
          In my previous life I was a restaurant chef with 8 years of diverse
          experience in the industry. I began that journey as a bread baker and
          grew into restaurant cooking where I spent the bulk of my time on the
          saute station. Some highlights of my career were being sous chef at
          Momofuku Milk Bar, cooking for James Beard award winning chef Spike
          Gjerde and living and working in Big Sky, MT. Be sure to visit my
          recipe page for some more detail and tasty samples.

          Currently, I am enrolled in Hack Reactor Software Engineering
          immersive and working away at building this portfolio out. I began
          this journey as a side project while I was working as a line cook at
          the Red Hen in Washington, DC, learning programming and web design
          basics from online resources. I’ve been curious about software design
          and its importance in the modern world. I want to contribute my skills
          to advancing our technological future!
